The transplants occurred while both men were undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, suggesting that the two treatments together could hold the secret to a cure.  We expected HIV to vanish from the patients\\u2019 plasma, but it is surprising that we can\\u2019t find any traces of HIV in their cells,  said one of the doctors. The case is similar to the man who was cured of HIV after getting stem-cell therapy for leukemia, but, as the bone marrow transplant patients are still taking their anti-retroviral medications, doctors are not yet 100% sure whether they are completely cured. Doctors also note that bone marrow transplants are expensive and too dangerous for many HIV patients.\",\n          \"(Oct 13, 2008  3:35 PM CDT) Weekend news of coordinated global action to buy stakes in troubled banks cheered investors, and the Dow posted its biggest-ever 1-day jump in both points and percentage today, MarketWatch reports.

Despite the cheery mood, many investors warned that numbers at the end of last week's sharp decline may not have marked the bottom for this crisis: Spreads between high-yield corporate debt and Treasury bonds suggest that shocks from the crisis may depress the economy for the next year, leading to 8% unemployment.  I'm not sure if our economy has prepared itself for 8% unemployment,  said one economist.

The transplants occurred while both men were undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, suggesting that the two treatments together could hold the secret to a cure.  We expected HIV to vanish from the patients\\u2019 plasma, but it is surprising that we can\\u2019t find any traces of HIV in their cells,  said one of the doctors. The case is similar to the man who was cured of HIV after getting stem-cell therapy for leukemia, but, as the bone marrow transplant patients are still taking their anti-retroviral medications, doctors are not yet 100% sure whether they are completely cured. Doctors also note that bone marrow transplants are expensive and too dangerous for many HIV patients.\",\n          \"(Oct 13, 2008  3:35 PM CDT) Weekend news of coordinated global action to buy stakes in troubled banks cheered investors, and the Dow posted its biggest-ever 1-day jump in both points and percentage today, MarketWatch reports.

Despite the cheery mood, many investors warned that numbers at the end of last week's sharp decline may not have marked the bottom for this crisis: Spreads between high-yield corporate debt and Treasury bonds suggest that shocks from the crisis may depress the economy for the next year, leading to 8% unemployment.  I'm not sure if our economy has prepared itself for 8% unemployment,  said one economist.

The transplants occurred while both men were undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, suggesting that the two treatments together could hold the secret to a cure.  We expected HIV to vanish from the patients\\u2019 plasma, but it is surprising that we can\\u2019t find any traces of HIV in their cells,  said one of the doctors. The case is similar to the man who was cured of HIV after getting stem-cell therapy for leukemia, but, as the bone marrow transplant patients are still taking their anti-retroviral medications, doctors are not yet 100% sure whether they are completely cured. Doctors also note that bone marrow transplants are expensive and too dangerous for many HIV patients.\",\n          \"(Oct 13, 2008  3:35 PM CDT) Weekend news of coordinated global action to buy stakes in troubled banks cheered investors, and the Dow posted its biggest-ever 1-day jump in both points and percentage today, MarketWatch reports. The index rose 936.42 to 9,387.61, the Nasdaq jumped 194.74 to 1,844.25, and the S&P 500 rose 104.13 to 1,003.35. Morgan Stanley closed at $17.92, up 85%\\u00a0over Friday's close, after Mitsubishi UFJ sealed a deal to buy 21% of the financial-services behemoth. Despite the cheery mood, many investors warned that numbers at the end of last week's sharp decline may not have marked the bottom for this crisis: Spreads between high-yield corporate debt and Treasury bonds suggest that shocks from the crisis may depress the economy for the next year, leading to 8% unemployment.  I'm not sure if our economy has prepared itself for 8% unemployment,  said one economist.

Two men given bone marrow transplants no longer have any HIV virus detectable in their blood, creating hope that researchers could be closing in on a cure for the disease that causes AIDS, reports ABC News. The transplants occurred while both men were undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, suggesting that the two treatments together could hold the secret to a cure.  We expected HIV to vanish from the patients\\u2019 plasma, but it is surprising that we can\\u2019t find any traces of HIV in their cells,  said one of the doctors. The case is similar to the man who was cured of HIV after getting stem-cell therapy for leukemia, but, as the bone marrow transplant patients are still taking their anti-retroviral medications, doctors are not yet 100% sure whether they are completely cured. Doctors also note that bone marrow transplants are expensive and too dangerous for many HIV patients.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cloze_bert\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8321,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Measles Hasn't Been This Bad in [MASK] Years\",\n          \" [MASK] Female Redskins Employees Detail Sexual Harassment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### d.ii.

Howard Diamond, 56, was arrested Tuesday on charges that include conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and health care fraud, the AP reports. Prosecutors contend that Diamond began issuing prescriptions in 2010 that had no legitimate medical purpose. The prescriptions were for drugs such as fentanyl, hydrocodone, and morphine, according to the indictment. Authorities say the overdose deaths occurred in the Texas cities of Abilene, McKinney, and Sulphur Springs, and in the Oklahoma cities of Ardmore, Hugo, Idabel, and Yukon. In each case, the seven people died within a month of filling the prescription provided by Diamond, the indictment states. One person filled a prescription for methadone in May 2013 and was dead two days later. In another instance, a woman only identified in the indictment by the initials T.H. filled a prescription in July 2014 for alprazolam, morphine, oxycodone, and zolpidem. She died 10 days after receiving the drugs. Diamond pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday. He is due in court again on Friday for a detention hearing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6190,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1st Clown in Space Blasts Off\",\n          \"Mel Gibson's a Dad for 8th Time\",\n          \"Doctor Accused in 7 Deaths\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cloze\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6174,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"$____K in Cash Clogs Toilets in Geneva\",\n          \"Bush's '____ Logo Is Very Excited\",\n          \"Guess How Icelandic Couples Celebrated Surprise Soccer Win ____ Months Ago?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cloze_gt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 493,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"273\",\n          \"566\",\n          \"2.1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cloze_annotation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1630,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Paraphrase( 58,000 , K )\",\n          \"Add( Paraphrase( 5,000 , K ) , Paraphrase( 3,000 , K ) )\",\n          \"Round( 31.9 , 0 )\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"need_reasoning\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_bert\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6190,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" [MASK] st Clown in Space Blasts Off.

Two men given bone marrow transplants no longer have any HIV virus detectable in their blood, creating hope that researchers could be closing in on a cure for the disease that causes AIDS, reports ABC News. The transplants occurred while both men were undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, suggesting that the two treatments together could hold the secret to a cure.  We expected HIV to vanish from the patients\\u2019 plasma, but it is surprising that we can\\u2019t find any traces of HIV in their cells,  said one of the doctors. The case is similar to the man who was cured of HIV after getting stem-cell therapy for leukemia, but, as the bone marrow transplant patients are still taking their anti-retroviral medications, doctors are not yet 100% sure whether they are completely cured. Doctors also note that bone marrow transplants are expensive and too dangerous for many HIV patients.\",\n          \"Dow Gains [MASK] on New Bailouts. Weekend news of coordinated global action to buy stakes in troubled banks cheered investors, and the Dow posted its biggest-ever 1-day jump in both points and percentage today, MarketWatch reports. The index rose 936.42 to 9,387.61, the Nasdaq jumped 194.74 to 1,844.25, and the S&P 500 rose 104.13 to 1,003.35. Morgan Stanley closed at $17.92, up 85%\\u00a0over Friday's close, after Mitsubishi UFJ sealed a deal to buy 21% of the financial-services behemoth. Despite the cheery mood, many investors warned that numbers at the end of last week's sharp decline may not have marked the bottom for this crisis: Spreads between high-yield corporate debt and Treasury bonds suggest that shocks from the crisis may depress the economy for the next year, leading to 8% unemployment.  I'm not sure if our economy has prepared itself for 8% unemployment,  said one economist.

Howard Diamond, 56, was arrested Tuesday on charges that include conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and health care fraud, the AP reports. Prosecutors contend that Diamond began issuing prescriptions in 2010 that had no legitimate medical purpose. The prescriptions were for drugs such as fentanyl, hydrocodone, and morphine, according to the indictment. Authorities say the overdose deaths occurred in the Texas cities of Abilene, McKinney, and Sulphur Springs, and in the Oklahoma cities of Ardmore, Hugo, Idabel, and Yukon. In each case, the seven people died within a month of filling the prescription provided by Diamond, the indictment states. One person filled a prescription for methadone in May 2013 and was dead two days later. In another instance, a woman only identified in the indictment by the initials T.H. filled a prescription in July 2014 for alprazolam, morphine, oxycodone, and zolpidem. She died 10 days after receiving the drugs. Diamond pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday. He is due in court again on Friday for a detention hearing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6174,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"$ [MASK] K in Cash Clogs Toilets in Geneva\",\n          \"Bush's ' [MASK] Logo Is Very Excited\",\n          \"Guess How Icelandic Couples Celebrated Surprise Soccer Win [MASK] Months Ago?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 493,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"273\",\n          \"566\",\n          \"2.1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":40}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## g.

In what's believed to be the largest Hollywood divorce settlement in history, Mel Gibson is having to cough up $425 million—half of his estimated fortune—to ex-wife Robyn Denise Moore. The two, married 31 years and parents to seven children, didn't have a prenuptial agreement, so Moore is entitled to half his wealth under California law. Moore, a former dental nurse, is also entitled to half of any future residuals from films Gibson, 55, worked on while the two were married, reports People. The settlement was finalized by a judge last week. Gibson earned $600 million alone from his The Passion of the Christ. He also made money from real estate, including a Fiji island he bought for $15 million. Moore, 55, filed for divorce from Gibson in 2009 after he began a highly publicized, crazed affair with Oksana Grigorieva. Moore and Gibson met in the late 1970s when they were both tenants in a house in Australia. Of all their children, only a 12-year-old son is a minor and subject to a custody arrangement. The actor recently agreed to pay $750,000 to Grigorieva, mother of his toddler daughter, after the two broke up in an ugly split that involved leaked phone recordings of a ranting, racist Gibson screaming at Grigorieva.\n","850\n","\n","Peterson Offers $ [MASK] K Reward for Wife's Return.

The billionaire's three main competitors have spent a combined total of about $2.5 million, with controller William Thompson leading the way at $1.4 million. The election is 6 months away. Bloomberg spokesman Howard Wolfson denied that the money was buying votes.  Absolutely not,  he said.  We're engaging in a dialogue with voters. That's what any campaign does.  In 2005, Wolfson—then a vocal Bloomberg critic—said the mayor’s money was distorting  the terms of the debate.\n","Question: Bloomberg Drops $ [MASK] M on Campaign\n","Label: 18.7\n","\n","Context: So, you've heard that Americans typically wolf down more than 4,500 calories on Thanksgiving Day? That's what the Calorie Control Council says, but Tara Parker-Pope at the New York Times was skeptical. So she cooked up a highly indulgent Thanksgiving meal, including 6 ounces of turkey with crispy skin (299 calories), sausage stuffing (310), and a well-buttered dinner roll (310). Then came a fattening sweet-potato casserole (300), mashed with gravy and butter (140), and a few greens and cranberry sauce (208). Dessert was killer, naturally, with pumpkin pie (316), pecan pie (503), and whipped cream (100). But that came to just 2,486 calories. Sure, wine and a hefty breakfast could fill in the rest, but stomach size and nausea would make that a toughy. So the 4,500-count may well be an exaggeration that  diet food companies would like us to believe,  writes Parker-Pope. But make no mistake: Your heart and gall bladder will still suffer from indulgent eating.

But as the Los Angeles Times notes, one big mystery still hangs over the college admissions scandal: Who on earth paid $6.5 million to get their kid into school? Prosecutors have cited the payment since day one, but they haven't provided any more details.  We did not tie the amount to anyone by name,  says a spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Boston.  That is not public.  At least not yet. None of those charged so far paid a sum anywhere near that amount, notes the Times, suggesting that more salacious details are to come in the scandal. In the case of the $6.5 million payment, it's not even clear which school was involved, let alone the name of the parent.  The sheer size suggests that a Very Important Person was involved, not just the coach of a second-tier sport,  observes a post at American Thinker.\n","Question: Big Question About College Scandal: Who Paid $ [MASK] M?\n","Label: 6.5\n","\n","Context: The heist has led to spate of headlines—like this, and this, and this—of the  real Italian job  variety, playing off the 2003 movie.\n","Question: Venice Robbers Steal $ [MASK] M ... in Lagoon\n","Label: 1.7\n","\n","Context: Michael Steele’s getting a real flogging this morning for lavish spending, but hey, maybe he likes it that way. On a recent trip to California, FEC records show that Steele enjoyed a $9,099 stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel, spent another $6,596 at the nearby Four Seasons and—get this—dropped $1,946 at Voyeur West Hollywood, a bondage-themed topless nightclub.

The 18-year-old was digging around in the dirt on a hillside in central Israel as part of a project with other young people when he spotted a jar holding  what looked like very thin leaves.   When I looked again, I saw these were gold coins,  Cohen said. Along with another 18-year-old, he had uncovered a treasure: 425 coins of pure, 24-karat gold, more than 1,100 years old.  It was amazing,  Cohen said. It's an extremely rare find, archaeologists said, partly because gold coins often would have been melted down and made into coins for use in another regime. Experts said the stash was well hidden by someone who planned to come back for it, the New York Times reports, fastening the lid with a nail.  We can only guess what prevented him from returning to collect this treasure,  the archaeologists said. The Israeli teenagers were participating in national service before entering the military, per CNN.

Their find will help with that for others, as well, by increasing understanding of the area in the 9th century. Part of an empire running from what now is Algeria to Afghanistan, the area was ruled by the Islamic Abbasid Caliphate. A fragment of an Islamic coin in the teenagers' discovery connects the dynasty to a rival, ruled by the Byzantine emperor Theophilos. It could have arrived through trade or be the spoils of war.

But he's got what he says is another  revolutionary  initiative that he's pushing alongside that, reports the Washington Post: He wants to wipe out all $1.6 trillion of the country's student loan debt.  In a generation hard hit by the Wall Street crash of 2008, [this plan] forgives all student debt and ends the absurdity of sentencing an entire generation to a lifetime of debt for the 'crime' of getting a college education,  he says. CNN notes it will take about $2.2 trillion over 10 years to fund the debt relief and college package, and it lays out Sanders'  detailed roadmap  on paying for it: taxes on Wall Street, including a 0.5% tax on stock trades, a 0.1% fee on bonds, and 0.005% tax on derivatives, which all together he predicts could raise $2.4 trillion in a decade. Other candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro have also pushed for student loan forgiveness—but critics note Sanders' plan is inclusive for all families, including the highest-earning ones, while others' plans are more modest and geared toward the middle class and lower-income families.

Then 19, the woman identified only as  Jane Doe  was in the early stages of pregnancy when she said Thicklen raped her at various spots in the jail.

The move could eventually affect more than 2 million employees, but Obama's long-term goal is to increase the minimum wage across the board to $10.10 over three years—a goal he'll address in tonight's State of the Union. Fox News says the executive action is  the first of potentially many  tied to the address. The executive action will only apply to future, not existing, contracts, USA Today notes. In tonight's address, Obama will push Congress to pass legislation sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Rep. George Miller of California, which would not only increase the minimum wage but also tie it to inflation and increase the minimum wage for tipped workers for the first time in more than 20 years, the AP reports.

But a social web that  can unite a fragmented silent majority  has been far less kind to Islamic extremists, blasting their propaganda on YouTube, social networks, and blogs.

After centuries of persecution, Catholics have, in recent times, been able to be members of the professions and participate fully in the life of this country,  they write. But if enacted, same-sex marriage will restrict  the ability of Catholics to teach the truth about marriage in their schools, charitable institutions or places of worship.  The letter was signed by 1,054 priests and 13 other senior Catholic figures—nearly a quarter of Catholic priests in England and Wales—as the debate over gay marriage heats up in Britain. The letter even compares Prime Minister David Cameron to Henry VIII, who broke with the Catholic Church in order to divorce Katherine of Aragon in the 1500s. Henry VIII wanted to  redefine what was marriage,  they write, which launched an upheaval in England and made life  very difficult  for Catholics.

Sources tell the Los Angeles Times that the parents in question are those of Yusi Zhao, a Chinese student who was admitted to Stanford University in the spring of 2017. The sources say the parents made the payment to ringleader William Singer after meeting him through a Morgan Stanley financial adviser. They say Singer, whose scheme involved bribing coaches, got Zhao into Stanford through the school's sailing program, though there is no evidence she ever took part in the sport. Former Stanford sailing coach John Vandemoer has pleaded guilty to racketeering in connection with Singer's scam. Morgan Stanley adviser Michael Wu was fired in March, NBC reports. The company says he was terminated for  not cooperating with an internal investigation into the college admissions matter.  It's not clear how much Zhao and her parents, who have not been charged, knew about the scheme, the Times notes. The Stanford Daily reports that Zhao's father is Tao Zhao, co-founder and CEO of the Shandong Buchang pharmaceutical company.

The answer, apparently, was a resounding yes: Not long after, Susie Clark spotted a teardrop-shaped 3.69-carat gem that she's dubbed the Hallelujah Diamond, per a park release.  The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent, metallic shine,  says Park Interpreter Waymon Cox, who adds that the pinto bean-sized diamond is the biggest gem of the 122 found so far this year at the park. But it pales slightly in comparison to a 6.19-carat whopper found a year ago, and it's less than a tenth the size of the biggest ever found there: a 40.23-carat gem named the Uncle Sam (that one was uncovered during a 1924 mining project; the site was converted into a state park in 1972). Cox adds Clark also likely had a little help from recent rain, which washes dirt away, leaving diamonds to sparkle in the sun. The park's searchable 37.5-acre field is also plowed by staff to assist diamond hunters; the field is the only such site open to the public in the world, and those who find a diamond are free to do what they wish with it.

It was part of a spike in incidents involving emotional support animals, as reported by various airlines. Alaska Airlines was among those to update its rules in response: As of October 2018, it permits only dogs and cats with appropriate documentation, and the animal must be kept on a leash or in a carrier. Fox News reports that's not the policy that was in place on Dec. 18, 2017, when Mirna Gonzalez alleges the airline allowed a pit bull with  vicious propensities  to be uncontained, per her lawsuit. Awaiting a flight to Texas, Gonzalez had left 5-year-old Gabriella with a 13-year-old brother while she went to get coffee. She then heard a scream and turned to see Gabriella's face covered in blood, per the Washington Post. Gonzalez claims owner Michelle Brannan assented to her daughter's request to pet the pit bull apparently serving as an emotional support dog, which severed her tear duct and took a chunk out of her upper lip (see a graphic photo). Gabriella  required surgery to repair complex facial lacerations and a damaged tear duct,  per the suit filed Monday in Oregon's Multnomah County Circuit Court on behalf of the family from Pasco, Wash.

One would think a sword that old would be so decrepit it could never be wielded again, but a Hordaland County archaeologist says it just needs a little polish and a new grip to be good to go.

County conservator Per Morten Ekerhovd adds, per CNN:  It's quite unusual to find remnants from the Viking age that are so well preserved … it might be used today if you sharpened the edge.  The extreme weather in the area likely had something to do with the sword's relatively unscathed condition: The mountains are covered in snow and ice six months out of the year, and there's no humidity in the summer, so the sword would have been protected. No one's sure what the blade's backstory is yet, but scientists are already thinking beyond winter and into the springtime thaw.  When the snow has gone in spring, we will check the place where the sword was found,  Aksdal says.  If we find several objects, or a tomb, perhaps we can find the story behind the sword.

There were thousands of charges on the 181-page bill, he tells KOMO News. An earlier story from ABC 13 explains that he was charged $9,700 for each day in the ICU and $80,000 for 29 days on a ventilator, for instance. Fortunately, Medicare, supplemental insurance, and Congressional funding to help hospitals with coronavirus costs kicked in, and he only had to pay about $3,000. Even so, Flor's story highlights the shell shock that could come for many coronavirus patients. The news station says one national survey of healthcare claims found the average charge of a COVID hospitalization for someone without insurance is around $73,000; with insurance, it's around $38,000. The full cost of COVID hospitalizations for this year in the US is expected to be $17 billion, and one actuary studying that cost and its consequences says it will end up increasing taxes and insurance premiums:  What happens with the entire system is that COVID-19 is going to be expensive.  But, she notes, the true cost may not be known for quite some time, as the long-term effects of the disease are still being uncovered.

He was hit with a $1,635.93 Uber fare after accidentally taking the ride service from near the West Virginia University campus, where he was partying with friends last Friday night, to his home in New Jersey, CBS Philadelphia reports.  We went to a frat party and then went to the bar. I was getting drinks all night; I probably spent like $200 at the bar after already drinking all day,  Bachman says.

The cause of Blumberg's emotional turmoil: a fake,  inflammatory  Yelp review of his Massachusetts jewelry store posted by the son of a competitor, per NBC Boston. A jury decided March 22 that Adam Jacobs, whose father owns Toodie's Fine Jewelry, had purposely put up a false, multi-paragraph diss about Blumberg's store, Stephen Leigh Jewelers, in August 2013; Jacobs has to now pay Blumberg $34,500 for emotional distress, the Patriot Ledger reports. The  guest  who supposedly wrote the review said he'd visited Blumberg's store to buy a diamond engagement ring and  left this place sick to my stomach,  calling the shop  the biggest thief on the South Shore.  But Blumberg, who tells NBC he was  incensed  by the review, says that interaction never took place—and he started digging to find out who the  Adam J.  who'd posted it really was. His months-long detective work had him sifting through other Yelp reviews written by the same person and calling those reviewed businesses; eventually he was able to connect the dots. Blumberg says he had never met Jacobs, who works at his father's store, before this and  had no beef  with either him or his dad. The jury did let Toodie's, which had also been named in Blumberg's December 2013 complaint, off the hook.

In weighing petitions for spouses or fiancees, US Citizenship and Immigration Services goes by whether the marriage is legal in the home country and then whether the marriage would be legal in the state where the petitioner lives. Marriage between adults and minors is not uncommon in the US, and most states allow children to marry with some restrictions.

Sheriff Ric Bradshaw is confident the money his department has spent while assisting the Secret Service will be reimbursed by the federal government.  I do hope he is correct,  said Palm Beach County Administrator Verdenia Baker. The county sent letters to federal officials in December seeking reimbursement for the overtime security costs from Trump's five-day visit his Mar-a-lago estate in November, the Palm Beach Post reported Tuesday. Those costs were originally estimated at $250,000, but Bradshaw said the total will be closer to $300,000. Based on the revised number, the sheriff told the newspaper the security costs are amounting to about $60,000 a day during Trump's visits to the county. Aside from the five days in November, Trump stayed at Mar-a-lago 16 days in December. He has returned for two weekends so far in February. The sheriff's presidential detail is covered by overtime and doesn't compromise law enforcement for the rest of the county. Baker said the sheriff works closely with the Secret Service and would have a better feel about any reimbursement.  I have not received that type of information from anyone in writing,  Baker said. The sheriff says he assumes he'll eventually have a conversation about reimbursement with Trump  or with someone high up in his administration.

Per ABC News, Wickham and three friends, who are all black, arrived at Hong Shing Chinese Restaurant to celebrate his birthday on May 3, 2014. However, once they were seated, their server said they'd need to pay for their meal first, and when they questioned why, they were told it was restaurant policy. Wickham—who immigrated from Trinidad when he was 20 and says he's not used to racial profiling—was suspicious, however. After confirming with other patrons that they hadn't had to prepay, he confronted staff, who admitted his table was the only one asked to prepay, per Newsweek. They were offered and accepted a refund. A year later Wickham filed his complaint with the Ontario tribunal, which ruled April 18 the restaurant treated him like a  potential thief in waiting.   At that moment it hurt to be black,  the case's adjudicator wrote. In its response, the restaurant said it had experienced customers who  dine and dash  and so had started asking non-regulars to pay first. One of the men who was with Wickham, however, said he'd dined at Hong Shing about 20 times before the incident, the Washington Post notes. Hong Shing staff says the restaurant has since changed management; a business license search by the Globe & Mail shows the director as Colin Li, the son of the couple who opened the restaurant in 1997. Wickham, now 31, said on Twitter he's  grateful  for the tribunal's decision but  would trade [all] of this for the two hours of bonding taken away from us that night.

Police Commissioner William Bratton has floated one approach that's already getting some support: amnesty.  Warrants never go away. There's no expiration date,  says Bratton, who envisions a program in which people with outstanding warrants would be notified that their risk of arrest could disappear if they come forward.  It would be great to get rid of that backlog. It's not to our benefit from a policing standpoint to have all those warrants floating around out there.  Mayor Bill de Blasio's criminal justice coordinator says officials are investigating  how to safely reduce the number of already outstanding warrants.  Officials are redesigning the summons form itself, texting reminders to people ahead of their court dates, as well as cutting down court processing times to shrink the number of people who end up in jail for low-level offenses. They'll post summons data broken down by race for analysis, a concession to advocates who claim tickets disproportionately target minorities.

With this instrument—bang—all of a sudden we saw an immediate picture of an entire city that no one knew existed,  one of the archaeologists tells the Age. Atop a mountain, Mahendraparvata belonged to the Khmer Empire of southeast Asia, which dates between 800 and 1400 AD, NPR notes. Researchers then made their way to the site itself, using the Lidar data to navigate—along with help from an ex-Khmer Rouge soldier who lost a leg to landmines. The team discovered temple sites, signs of canals and roads, a cave full of ancient carvings, and a series of mounds that remain unexplained.

In the period from Jan. 1, 2014, to Oct. 31, 2015, more than 18,800 civilians were killed by the militant group, and nearly 36,250 were wounded. And the death toll, which the UN calls  staggering,  was brought about via beheadings, shootings, burning victims alive, throwing them off buildings, and even bulldozing. But there are others suffering a different horrible fate: Per the report by the UN's Assistance Mission for Iraq and its human rights division, about 3,500 Iraqis are being held as slaves.  Those being held are predominantly women and children and come primarily from the Yezidi community, but a number are also from other ethnic and religious minority communities,  the report reads. The report notes that verified information suggests between 800 and 900 Iraqi children in Mosul alone had been snatched for religious indoctrination and to be incorporated into ISIS' military ranks, Business Insider reports. Some of those child soldiers were murdered when they tried to run from fighting in Anbar province, Fox News notes. Others in Iraq who haven't been targeted through outright violence have perished from hunger, thirst, or lack of medical care.

Researchers discovered that 12% more male fetuses were lost in the 20th week of pregnancy than in a  normal  September. Fewer boys were born in all states up to 4 months after 9/11. Scientists blame  communal bereavement,  which is acute mental distress linked to a major national tragedy, even if the pregnant woman has no direct connection to people involved in the event, notes the BBC. Pregnant women and male fetuses are particularly sensitive to such stress, scientists believe.  Across many species, stressful times reportedly reduce the male birth rate,  said lead researcher Tim Bruckner, who believes the miscarriage rate was actually significantly higher because they tend to be under-reported.

Yes, because  at its heart, 9/11 was meaningless,  writes Laura Miller at Salon.  I realize that sounds inflammatory, but hear me out.  A novelist explores  the winding and unwinding of long strands of cause and effect, in the reasons people do things and the often unanticipated results they get.  And it's hard to infuse that into the 2,996 deaths of 9/11. Those deaths were simply  abrupt and unanticipated, as is the case with most disasters.  Miller admits that police and firefighters  are the great exception  because they sacrificed their lives on 9/11—yet a firefighter who dies in any fire  is no less brave or heroic.  Some novelists have tried to find meaning in 9/11 deaths anyway, but Miller considers their efforts sentimental or self-aggrandizing. She prefers less literal books, like James Hyne's Next, about a self-absorbed man about to die in a 9/11-like attack. Yet the novel never reaches his demise, because there is  next to nothing, perhaps nothing at all,  to say about death itself.

That year the International Atomic Energy Agency also warned of the danger of a  nuclear 9/11  if more wasn’t done to protect uranium and plutonium supplies.

One possibility is the reinstatement of a national registry of visitors from high-risk countries. The revelation comes from a Reuters interview of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who is known for his anti-immigration views within the GOP and who has been advising Trump since the campaign's early days. Kobach said Trump's transition team is considering dusting off the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which Kobach himself helped design as a member of George W. Bush's Justice Department in the wake of 9/11. Under the program, people from nations deemed high-risk had to undergo interrogations, fingerprinting, and, in some cases, periodic check-ins upon entering the US. The program, NSEERS, was abandoned in 2011.  These programs had Kobach's signature all over them,  the director of the Migration Policy Institute tells NBC News.  Now, the architect of the old program again has a seat at the table.  Kobach, in fact, is rumored to be on Trump's list of attorney general candidates, reports McClatchy. Meanwhile, a spokesman for a pro-Trump super PAC has drawn attention for saying the mass internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII could serve as a model for Trump's policy on Muslim immigrants.

He did not say whether al-Fadhli was killed by a drone or a piloted aircraft.

Officials say the Khorasan Group is embedded in the al Nusra front, Syria's al-Qaeda affiliate. Previously based in Iran, al-Fadhli was the subject of a $7 million reward by the State Department for information leading to his capture or death. He had been falsely reported as having been killed last fall. He also was reportedly involved in October 2002 attacks against US Marines on Faylaka Island in Kuwait and on the French ship MV Limburg.

Scientists blame  communal bereavement,  which is acute mental distress linked to a major national tragedy, even if the pregnant woman has no direct connection to people involved in the event, notes the BBC. Pregnant women and male fetuses are particularly sensitive to such stress, scientists believe.

In making the case that the NSA's phone-tracking program is an essential tool against terrorism, Judge William Pauley cited the example of 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar. If the current system had been in place back then, the NSA would have realized that al-Mihdhar had been making calls from the US before the attack, the judge suggested. Instead, the agency assumed he was overseas. Bottom line: The NSA's surveillance program might have helped prevent 9/11, according to the argument. Pauley's footnote on the incident says,  See generally, The 9/11 Commission Report.  The problem with that, writes Justin Elliott, is that the 9/11 report  doesn't actually include the account he gives in the ruling.

Yes, because  at its heart, 9/11 was meaningless,  writes Laura Miller at Salon.  I realize that sounds inflammatory, but hear me out.  A novelist explores  the winding and unwinding of long strands of cause and effect, in the reasons people do things and the often unanticipated results they get.  And it's hard to infuse that into the 2,996 deaths of 9/11. Those deaths were simply  abrupt and unanticipated, as is the case with most disasters.  Miller admits that police and firefighters  are the great exception  because they sacrificed their lives on 9/11—yet a firefighter who dies in any fire  is no less brave or heroic.  Some novelists have tried to find meaning in 9/11 deaths anyway, but Miller considers their efforts sentimental or self-aggrandizing. She prefers less literal books, like James Hyne's Next, about a self-absorbed man about to die in a 9/11-like attack. Yet the novel never reaches his demise, because there is  next to nothing, perhaps nothing at all,  to say about death itself.

We tortured some folks,  Obama said at a televised news conference at the White House.  We did some things that were contrary to our values.  Addressing the impending release of a Senate report that criticizes CIA treatment of detainees, Obama said he believed the mistreatment stemmed from the pressure national security officials felt to forestall another attack. He said Americans should not be too  sanctimonious  about passing judgment through the lens of a seemingly safer present day. That view, which he expressed as a candidate for national office in 2008 and early in his presidency, explains why Obama did not push to pursue criminal charges against the Bush era officials who carried out the CIA program.

On Jan. 1, 2002, his 36-year-old spouse was found shot to death in their upscale Denver home. Sonnenfeld insisted she killed herself, but prosecutors filed murder charges against him—only to drop them five months later. Then they charged him again in 2003, before discovering that he had moved to Argentina. The case involves the intricacies of forensics, theories about gun angles, a possible suicide note, and now international borders. But as a lengthy piece in GQ explains, that's only the half of it. It was only in Argentina that Sonnenfeld's work as an official videographer at Ground Zero for the federal government entered the picture. Sonnenfeld, with the help of his new wife in Argentina, has over the years become a media superstar in the country by championing the idea that the US knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance. Among other things, he argues that he was summoned by FEMA suspiciously fast, and he speculates about why a vault found in the wreckage was empty—FEMA must have emptied it in advance. So, sure, he sounds like a crackpot. But his advocates say that the US government wants to have him extradited on the murder charges so he can be silenced through execution. If the truther-ism is a ploy, it seems to be working: The Argentine government refuses to extradite him, even though Denver authorities say they're not interested in the death penalty.

Stroman claimed the shooting spree that killed two men and injured a third targeted people of Middle Eastern descent, though all three victims were from South Asia. It was the death of 49-year-old Vasudev Patel, a Hindu, that put Stroman on death row. The lone survivor, Rais Bhuiyan, unsuccessfully sued to stop the execution, saying his Muslim beliefs told him to forgive Stroman. The courts denied his requests. From the death chamber, Stroman asked for God's grace and said hate in the world had to stop.

Since 2004, there have been at least 268 perimeter breaches at America's 31 busiest airports, with intruders including drunk drivers, people taking shortcuts, stowaways, skateboarders, a mentally ill man who hopped the fence eight times at LAX in the space of less than a year, and a man who went through Washington's Reagan National Airport to recharge his boat's battery after it failed, according to an AP snapshot of cases. The intruders sneaked past security posts, rammed gates, climbed fences, and, in one case in Florida, dug under a fence. At least 44 intruders made it as far as runways or gate areas, according to the AP, which notes that the total is probably an undercount: Two airports didn't provide full information, and Boston's Logan Airport refused to provide any at all for security reasons. Airport officials say the fact that intruders were caught shows that security systems generally work well, although for security reasons, not many airports would say how long it took to catch them.

Trump continued to insist that he saw  thousands  of Muslims celebrating in New Jersey during the 9/11 attacks and said he had received hundreds of phone calls and tweets of support, Politico reports. No video or other proof of what Trump claims he saw surfaced, however, and in a phone call to NBC News Monday afternoon, he made another two dubious claims:  I have the world's greatest memory,  he said.

Other candidates rejected Trump's claim, including Marco Rubio, who said,  It's not true and there's plenty of fact-checks to prove that it isn't,  CNN reports. As law enforcement and government officials also called Trump's account of events clearly untrue, the candidate not only doubled down on his remarks, he demanded an apology, citing a Sept. 18, 2001, Washington Post article that stated New Jersey authorities detained people  allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops.

The papers detail the findings of a congressional inquiry into what foreign entities provided support to the 9/11 hijackers while they planned the attacks. Former Sen. Bob Graham, who helped lead that inquiry, notes a White House official told him intel officers are reviewing the docs.  The most important unanswered question of 9/11 is: Did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported?  he said on Sunday's Meet the Press, adding he finds it  implausible  they could have carried out such a plan without outside aid, per the Hill.  All the evidence points to Saudi Arabia,  he said.

We tortured some folks,  Obama said at a televised news conference at the White House.  We did some things that were contrary to our values.  Addressing the impending release of a Senate report that criticizes CIA treatment of detainees, Obama said he believed the mistreatment stemmed from the pressure national security officials felt to forestall another attack. He said Americans should not be too  sanctimonious  about passing judgment through the lens of a seemingly safer present day. That view, which he expressed as a candidate for national office in 2008 and early in his presidency, explains why Obama did not push to pursue criminal charges against the Bush era officials who carried out the CIA program. To this day, many of those officials insist that what they did was not torture, which is a felony under US law. The president's comments are a blow to those former officials, as well as an estimated 200 people currently working at the CIA who played some role in the interrogation program. In a 2009 speech, Obama trumpeted his ban of  so-called enhanced interrogation techniques  and  brutal methods,  but did not flatly say the US had engaged in torture.

As an arch-atheist, Hitchens doesn’t much like the Cordoba Initiative, or any of the supposed  moderate  Muslims behind it, but he’s appalled that its opponents have resorted to a  part-pathetic and part-sinister appeal to demagogy.  From Sarah Palin to the Anti-Defamation League, opponents claim that they’re just parroting the families of 9/11 victims, and others who find the mosque offensive. This argument  borrows straight from the playbook of Muslim cultural blackmail,  Hitchens argues.  Claim that something is ‘offensive’ and it is as if the assertion itself had automatically become an argument.

But nearly a decade later, she's still fighting to adopt the girl, now 14. DNAinfo explains why: Edward Kranz, the banker whose fling with Catherine Gorayeb resulted in her pregnancy, showed a sudden interest in his daughter after learning in 2004 that her mother died in the Twin Towers—despite the fact that he had initially denied fathering the girl, then gave up his custody rights in January 2000 so that he wouldn't have to pay child support after a DNA test showed he was likely the father. In addition to Kranz, a further complication involves a court-appointed guardian who has been scrutinizing how Claire Gorayeb used the nearly $2 million her niece was awarded from the 9/11 victims compensation fund: $900,000 was spent on an Upper West Side apartment (it's in both her and her niece's name).
